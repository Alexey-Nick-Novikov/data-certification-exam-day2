{
    "MEDIAN_AGE": "\nThe median age has a positive effect on the number of crimes since it's coefficient is positive (2252.7344)\n",
    "T_STAT": "\nt-statistic (t) for the median age is equal to 1.820.\nIt is computed based on the null hypothesis H0: the median age is not correlated with the number of crimes. \nIn other words, coef(median age) = 0 if the H0 is true.\n\nThe formula: t = (calculated coef - H0 coef) / (std err)\n",
    "P_VALUE": "\nThe p-value associated with the median age is a probability that what we observe is just due to pure chance.\nIf p-value < 0.05 (for 95% confidence level) or < 0.10 (for 95% confidence level) \nit means that there is a very high chance that the feature is statistically correlated to the target.\nIn our case p-value = 0.128, therefore the effect of the median age on the crime level is not statistically significant.\n",
    "INCREASE": "\nHaving all other parameters fixed, increasing the share of families with a married couple by 1% will decrease the total number \nof incidents by approximately 2115. The coefficient related to this feature is negative (-2115.183942), hence the decrease.\n",
    "LIMITATIONS": "\nFirst of all, we haven't performed any feature normalization!!! It is difficult to estimate the influence of the features\nif they are not of the same order.\n\nSecond, the more features we add to the model, the higher (usually) the R2. It is always better to start with fewer features\nand increase their number if the model is still not good. And check everytime the statistical significance of the coef!\n\nThird, it would be great to check for the correlation between the features (via VIF analysism for example). \n\nHowever, since Prob(F-statistic) < 0.05 --> at least 1 independent variable is related to Y. So, keep trying! ;)\n"
